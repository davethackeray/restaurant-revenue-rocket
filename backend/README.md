# Backend for Restaurant Revenue Rocket

This directory is a placeholder for the backend of the "Restaurant Revenue Rocket" application. It will contain server-side code for API integrations, AI decision-making modules, and simulation engines as part of the Agentic AI Demonstration Framework.

## Status
- **Placeholder**: This directory and its contents are currently placeholders created to establish the project structure. Full implementation will be developed as part of Phase 2: Core Agentic AI Development.

## Planned Components
- Express.js server for API endpoints.
- Integration with Gemini API for AI decision-making.
- Database schemas for PostgreSQL to store AI decision logs and simulation states.
- Simulation engine to model restaurant operations.

## Next Steps
Full backend implementation will be developed following the roadmap outlined in `docs/development-roadmap-agentic-ai.md`.
