# Phase 2: Core Agentic AI Development Progress (Weeks 3-6)

## Overview
This document tracks the progress of Phase 2: Core Agentic AI Development for the Agentic AI Demonstration Framework within "Restaurant Revenue Rocket." The goal of this phase is to build the foundational components for autonomous AI behavior, focusing on decision-making modules, simulation engines, and backend integrations. This phase spans Weeks 3-6, with detailed tasks scheduled to ensure systematic development and testing.

## Software Engineering (SWE) Principles
The development in Phase 2 adheres to the SWE principles established in Phase 1 ('docs/phase1-research-design-progress.md'), with an emphasis on:
1. **Mission Alignment**: All code and components must directly support demonstrating AI integration for restaurant businesses.
2. **Thorough Analysis Before Action**: Validate designs and logic before implementation to minimize rework.
3. **Incremental Progress with Validation**: Develop in small, testable increments, ensuring each component works before integration.
4. **Documentation as a First-Class Citizen**: Maintain detailed documentation of code, APIs, and progress for team clarity and future reference.
5. **Focus on User Impact**: Ensure AI behaviors enhance demo engagement and learning outcomes for end-users.
6. **Risk Mitigation and Contingency Planning**: Address technical risks (e.g., API failures) with robust fallbacks and error handling.
7. **Adherence to Schedule with Flexibility**: Follow the roadmap timeline while allowing adjustments for critical issues or insights.
8. **Code Quality and Standards**: Write modular, readable code adhering to project standards, using linting tools (`npm run lint`).
9. **Continuous Feedback Loop**: Test early and often, incorporating internal feedback to refine functionality.
10. **Avoid Scope Creep**: Limit development to Phase 2 deliverables, deferring additional features to later phases.

These principles guide the development process to ensure high-quality, focused output aligned with project goals.
