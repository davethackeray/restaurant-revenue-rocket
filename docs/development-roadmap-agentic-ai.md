# Development Roadmap for Agentic AI Demonstration Framework

## Overview
This roadmap outlines the steps to develop an Agentic AI Demonstration Framework for "Restaurant Revenue Rocket," an interactive web application designed to showcase AI integration opportunities for restaurant businesses. The goal is to extend the existing AI capabilities (currently using the Google Gemini API) into an agentic framework where AI can autonomously simulate restaurant management decisions, interact dynamically with users, and automate operational tasks within the gamified scenarios.

## Objectives
- **Autonomous Decision-Making**: Enable AI to make decisions within restaurant scenarios (e.g., inventory management, staffing adjustments) based on real-time data and predefined goals.
- **Interactive Simulations**: Develop AI-driven simulations that adapt to user inputs and demonstrate the impact of AI decisions on restaurant operations and revenue.
- **Integration with Existing Systems**: Ensure compatibility with the current tech stack (React frontend, Node.js backend, PostgreSQL, Redis, Docker) and Gemini API.
- **Offline Capability**: Support offline demonstrations by implementing fallback mechanisms for agentic AI behaviors.
- **User Engagement**: Enhance the gamified experience by allowing users to observe and interact with AI-driven scenarios, learning from autonomous AI actions.

## Current State Analysis
- **AI Integration**: The application uses the Google Gemini API (model: gemini-2.0-flash) for AI assistance, with configurable parameters like max tokens (2048) and temperature (0.7).
- **Demo Environment**: The platform supports 10 interactive scenarios tailored to different restaurant types (e.g., fine dining, quick service) with client profiles and real-time ROI calculations.
- **Offline Mode**: An offline mode is available with fallback responses, crucial for demonstrations without internet access.
- **Architecture**: The application is split into frontend (React, TypeScript) and backend (Node.js, Express), with Docker-managed PostgreSQL and Redis for local deployment.
