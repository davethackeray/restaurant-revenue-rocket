- **AI Approach**: Use reinforcement learning to simulate inventory scenarios, learning optimal ordering policies by balancing stock levels against demand forecasts and cost constraints.

### 2. Dynamic Pricing of Menu Items
- **Description**: Adjusting menu prices in real-time based on factors like time of day, customer traffic, competitor pricing, ingredient costs, and demand elasticity.
- **Rationale**:
  - **Revenue Impact**: Increases profitability by capitalizing on peak demand periods (e.g., raising prices during dinner rush) or incentivizing off-peak sales with discounts.
  - **Cost Reduction**: Helps manage inventory by pricing items to move excess stock before spoilage.
  - **Operational Efficiency**: Automates pricing decisions, eliminating the need for constant manager oversight.
  - **Demo Engagement**: Illustrates AI's strategic decision-making in balancing revenue goals with customer satisfaction, providing a clear visual of financial outcomes in simulations.
- **Priority**: High. Dynamic pricing can significantly affect revenue and is a sophisticated use case for AI, appealing to demo audiences interested in revenue optimization.
- **AI Approach**: Implement goal-directed AI to set pricing goals (e.g., maximize profit margin) and adjust prices dynamically using predefined rules and real-time data inputs.

### 3. Staff Scheduling and Shift Optimization
- **Description**: Determining optimal staff schedules based on predicted customer traffic, staff availability, labor costs, and service quality requirements.
- **Rationale**:
  - **Revenue Impact**: Ensures adequate staffing during peak times to maintain service quality, preventing customer dissatisfaction and lost sales.
  - **Cost Reduction**: Avoids overstaffing during slow periods, reducing labor costs, which are a significant expense in restaurants.
  - **Operational Efficiency**: Streamlines scheduling, reducing time spent on manual roster creation and last-minute adjustments.
  - **Demo Engagement**: Demonstrates AI's ability to balance cost and service quality, a relatable challenge for restaurant managers, enhancing the learning experience.
- **Priority**: Medium-High. Labor costs are a major operational expense, and automation here offers clear cost-saving potential with visible demo impact.
- **AI Approach**: Use multi-agent systems where agents represent different roles (e.g., kitchen, front-of-house) and coordinate schedules to optimize coverage and cost, adapting to real-time traffic data.

### 4. Customer Service Responses
- **Description**: Automating responses to customer inquiries, feedback, or complaints through chat interfaces or during demo interactions, tailored to sentiment and context.
- **Rationale**:
  - **Revenue Impact**: Improves customer satisfaction and loyalty by providing timely, personalized responses, potentially increasing repeat business.
  - **Cost Reduction**: Reduces the need for staff to handle routine inquiries, freeing them for other tasks.
  - **Operational Efficiency**: Speeds up response times, enhancing the customer experience without additional labor.
  - **Demo Engagement**: Highlights AI's ability to handle interpersonal interactions, showing how technology can enhance customer relations, a key aspect of restaurant success.
- **Priority**: Medium. While not directly tied to core financial metrics like inventory or pricing, customer service impacts long-term revenue through retention and is engaging for demo users.
- **AI Approach**: Leverage the Gemini API for natural language processing to generate context-aware responses, with agentic AI deciding response tone and content based on customer sentiment analysis.

### 5. Menu Optimization
- **Description**: Deciding which menu items to promote, modify, or remove based on sales performance, customer preferences, ingredient availability, and profitability analysis.
- **Rationale**:
  - **Revenue Impact**: Promotes high-margin or popular items to boost sales, while phasing out underperforming dishes to focus on profitable offerings.
  - **Cost Reduction**: Aligns menu offerings with inventory to reduce waste and procurement costs for low-demand items.
  - **Operational Efficiency**: Simplifies kitchen operations by focusing on a streamlined menu, reducing preparation complexity.
  - **Demo Engagement**: Shows AI's strategic role in menu planning, a creative and business-critical decision, making for an interesting simulation in demos.
- **Priority**: Medium. Menu optimization affects revenue and costs but is less frequent and urgent compared to inventory or pricing decisions.
- **AI Approach**: Use reinforcement learning to test menu configurations in simulated environments, optimizing for sales and profit metrics over time.

## Prioritized List of Decisions for Automation
1. **Inventory Ordering Based on Predicted Demand** - Highest priority due to direct impact on revenue and cost, with strong demo appeal.
2. **Dynamic Pricing of Menu Items** - High priority for revenue optimization and showcasing sophisticated AI decision-making.
3. **Staff Scheduling and Shift Optimization** - Medium-High priority for significant cost savings and operational relevance in demos.
