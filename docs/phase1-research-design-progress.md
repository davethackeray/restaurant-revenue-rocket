# Phase 1: Research and Design Progress (Weeks 1-2)

## Overview
This document tracks the progress of Phase 1: Research and Design for the Agentic AI Demonstration Framework within "Restaurant Revenue Rocket." The goal of this phase is to define the scope and technical requirements for agentic AI within the restaurant scenarios. This phase spans Weeks 1-2, with detailed tasks scheduled on a day-by-day basis to ensure thoroughness and focus.

## Software Engineering (SWE) Principles
To maintain focus on the mission and avoid distractions during the development of the Agentic AI Demonstration Framework, the following SWE principles will guide all activities. These principles are designed to ensure high-quality output, adherence to project goals, and efficient progress without deviation from the core objectives:

1. **Mission Alignment**: Every task, decision, and line of code must directly contribute to the goal of demonstrating AI integration opportunities for restaurant businesses through agentic behaviors. Any activity not aligned with this mission will be deprioritized or discarded.
2. **Thorough Analysis Before Action**: Before committing to code or design decisions, conduct exhaustive research and validation of concepts to prevent rework. This includes reviewing existing literature, codebase, and stakeholder input to ensure informed decision-making.
3. **Incremental Progress with Validation**: Break down tasks into small, manageable steps with clear deliverables. Validate each step through testing or peer review before proceeding to the next to catch issues early and maintain quality.
4. **Documentation as a First-Class Citizen**: Document all research findings, design decisions, and progress updates in real-time to maintain clarity for the team and future reference. This ensures transparency and prevents loss of critical insights.
5. **Focus on User Impact**: Prioritize features and designs that enhance user engagement and learning within the gamified demo environment. Continuously evaluate how agentic AI decisions will be perceived and understood by end-users (consultants and clients).
6. **Risk Mitigation and Contingency Planning**: Identify potential risks (technical, operational, ethical) at every stage and proactively develop mitigation strategies. Always have a fallback plan to avoid delays or derailment.
7. **Adherence to Schedule with Flexibility**: Stick to the planned timeline for each task to maintain momentum, but allow flexibility for deeper exploration if critical insights or blockers are encountered, ensuring they are documented and communicated.
8. **Code Quality and Standards**: Even in research and prototyping phases, maintain high coding standards (e.g., modularity, readability) to facilitate future development. Use linting and formatting tools as per project setup (`npm run lint`).
9. **Continuous Feedback Loop**: Regularly seek feedback from stakeholders or internal testing to refine approaches, ensuring alignment with project goals and user needs before moving to subsequent phases.
10. **Avoid Scope Creep**: Strictly limit the scope of research and design to the defined deliverables of Phase 1. Additional ideas or features will be noted for future phases but not pursued during this period to prevent sidetracking.

These principles will be revisited and refined as needed at the end of each phase to adapt to lessons learned, but they serve as the foundation for maintaining focus and delivering value throughout the development process.

## Scheduled Tasks
Below are the detailed tasks for Phase 1 as outlined in the roadmap (docs/development-roadmap-agentic-ai.md). Each task is sequential, with progress updates to be added as they are completed:

1. **Day 1-2: Conduct Literature Review on Agentic AI Concepts**
   - Focus on reinforcement learning, goal-directed AI systems, and multi-agent systems suitable for simulation and decision-making in business contexts.
   - Research existing frameworks and case studies in AI-driven business simulations to identify best practices and potential pitfalls.
   - Document findings in a summary report, highlighting applicability to restaurant scenarios.
   - **Progress**: Completed. Findings are documented in 'docs/phase1-literature-review-agentic-ai.md'.

2. **Day 3-4: Analyze Existing AI Integration in "Restaurant Revenue Rocket"**
   - Review Gemini API usage in the codebase to understand current capabilities (e.g., response generation, parameter settings like max tokens and temperature) and limitations (e.g., latency, offline mode constraints).
   - Identify integration points in backend and frontend where agentic AI can extend current functionality.
   - Document observations and potential enhancement areas.
   - **Progress**: Completed. Analysis is documented in 'docs/phase1-gemini-api-analysis.md'.

3. **Day 5-6: Identify Key Restaurant Management Decisions to Automate**
   - Target decisions such as inventory ordering based on predicted demand, dynamic pricing, staff scheduling, customer service responses, and menu optimization.
   - Consult domain experts (if available) or existing literature on restaurant operations to prioritize decisions with high ROI potential.
   - Create a prioritized list of decisions for automation, with rationale for each.
   - **Progress**: Completed. Findings are documented in 'docs/phase1-restaurant-decisions-automation.md'.

4. **Day 7-8: Brainstorm Potential Risks and Challenges**
   - Consider risks in automating decisions, including data accuracy issues, user acceptance barriers, ethical considerations (e.g., fairness in pricing), and technical limitations (e.g., API downtime).
   - Document mitigation strategies for each identified risk, such as fallback mechanisms, user override options, and data validation checks.
   - **Progress**: Completed. Findings are documented in 'docs/phase1-risks-challenges-mitigation.md'.

5. **Day 9-10: Design AI Agent Architecture**
   - Specify how the AI agent will integrate with the Gemini API for decision-making logic, handle real-time user interaction, and manage state transitions within scenarios.
   - Outline components such as decision engine, state manager, and interaction handler, ensuring modularity for future extensions.

   - **Progress**: Completed. Design is documented in 'docs/phase1-ai-agent-architecture.md'.

6. **Day 11-12: Plan Data Structures for AI Decision History and Scenario States**
   - Design schemas for storing AI decision history, scenario states, and user interactions in PostgreSQL (for persistent data) and Redis (for transient, fast-access data).
   - Ensure scalability (e.g., indexing for quick retrieval) and data integrity (e.g., relational constraints in PostgreSQL).
   - Document schema designs with field descriptions and usage scenarios.
   - **Progress**: Completed. Design is documented in 'docs/phase1-data-structures.md'.

7. **Day 13: Draft Technical Specification Document**
