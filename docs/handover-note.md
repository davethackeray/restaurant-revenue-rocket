# Handover Note for Agentic AI Demonstration Framework - Restaurant Revenue Rocket

## Introduction
This handover note is prepared for the next Software Engineer taking over the development of the Agentic AI Demonstration Framework within "Restaurant Revenue Rocket." The purpose of this document is to summarize the progress made during Phases 1 and 2 of the project, provide an overview of the current state, and outline the next steps as per the development roadmap ('docs/development-roadmap-agentic-ai.md'). This note aims to ensure a smooth transition and continuity in the development process.

## Project Overview
"Restaurant Revenue Rocket" is an interactive web application designed to showcase AI integration opportunities for restaurant businesses. The goal of the Agentic AI Demonstration Framework is to extend existing AI capabilities (using the Google Gemini API) into an agentic framework where AI can autonomously simulate restaurant management decisions, interact dynamically with users, and automate operational tasks within gamified scenarios. The framework focuses on autonomous decision-making, interactive simulations, integration with existing systems (React frontend, Node.js backend, PostgreSQL, Redis, Docker), offline capability, and user engagement.

## Current State
- **Phase 1**: Completed. All research and design tasks are finalized, with comprehensive documentation covering agentic AI concepts, existing system analysis, target decisions for automation, risk mitigation strategies, AI agent architecture, data structures, and technical specifications.
- **Phase 2**: Completed. Core agentic AI components, including AI decision-making modules for inventory, staffing, and pricing, a simulation engine with feedback loops, database schemas, Redis caching, and backend API endpoints, are fully implemented and refined. Unit testing tasks remain pending and are a priority.
- **Phase 3**: Partially Completed. Progress includes:
  - **Week 7**: Frontend setup with React components for AI decision visualization and API integration using Redux for state management.
  - **Week 8, Day 1-5**: Extended demo profile JSON files with AI behavior parameters for different restaurant types (fine dining and quick service) and updated backend profile loading logic to apply these parameters during scenario initialization.
- **Technical Setup**: The development environment is set up with Node.js, Docker containers for PostgreSQL and Redis, and necessary dependencies installed. Configuration for Gemini API integration is in place, though a valid API key is required for full functionality.
- **Codebase**: Key components are located in 'backend/src/' and 'frontend/src/' directories, with corresponding documentation in the 'docs/' directory.

## Next Steps
