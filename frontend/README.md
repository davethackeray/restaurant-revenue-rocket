# Frontend for Restaurant Revenue Rocket

This directory is a placeholder for the frontend of the "Restaurant Revenue Rocket" application. It will contain the user interface code for interactive simulations and demonstrations of AI-driven restaurant management decisions as part of the Agentic AI Demonstration Framework.

## Status
- **Placeholder**: This directory and its contents are currently placeholders created to establish the project structure. Full implementation will be developed as part of Phase 3: Integration with Demonstration Platform.

## Planned Components
- React.js application for scenario rendering and user interaction.
- Components to visualize AI decisions and simulation results (e.g., decision cards, graphs).
- Integration with backend API endpoints for fetching AI decisions and simulation data.
- State management using Redux or Context API for real-time updates.

## Next Steps
Full frontend implementation will be developed following the roadmap outlined in `docs/development-roadmap-agentic-ai.md`.
